### ⚡ Installation

First, authenticate yourself on the page https://discord.com/developers/applications

If you don't have a bot yet, create one by clicking on "New application", fill in the requested information and in the bot tab don't forget to click on "Add bot".

Open your console using the shortcut `win+X+C`, navigate to the directory where you want to install the bot using the command `cd pathToDirectory` and then download the project using the command `git clone https://github.com/ZerioDev/Discord-dashboard.git` (requires git installed).

Fill the `config.js` file with the required information:
- The token of your bot is in the bot tab, by default you can't read it but there is a button to copy it.
- The "secret client" is in the general information tab, as for the token there is a button to copy it.
- If you develop locally you can leave the default values for the dashboard part, otherwise I guess you have enough knowledge to host a project online.

Then type `npm i` to install the project dependencies and `npm start` to launch the bot. A link to the dashboard should then be displayed in the console.
